Target user profile

My CVs target user is for companies that are looking for young employees.
More specifically companies related to the world of computing.

Information architecture
------------------------
The architecture of the CV consists in two columns with six rows. In these six rows,
half form part of the upper section, while the bottom three form part of the lower section.
On the left is an image with my face and my contact information.

Visual design
-------------
For the visual part I have implemented some icons so that the user can identify the sections more quickly.
I have used light colors to give a clean feeling. I have also used vars to easily distinguish the sections of the CV.
